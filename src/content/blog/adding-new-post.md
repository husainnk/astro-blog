  My experience and take with the FromSoftware's 2023 release Elden Ring
---

Elden Ring is not my first FromSoftware. I always heard DarkSouls series is one of the hardest game to beat. And so many players stop after initial few hours. 
I am not surprised when I played the Dark Souls PS5 Remastered version. The game starts with 5 minute lore and most words are quite cryptic, expected to give the premise of the game.

There is no Quest log. You have to figure out on your own and the first boss you encounter, single hit is enough to loss your 70% of your HP. So like everyone else I stopped playing and started Spideman-2.
